Local modifications:
 - Only imported the pex source (no tests/docs).
 - Disabled the part of the twitter PEX code that auto-detects the setuptools package from the
   system, as this got more problematic to fake in our own `pkg_resources` module.
 - Fixed usage of os.link (does not exist on windows).
 - Fixed prebuilt package resolution when pexs have '#' in the name.
 - Added the ability to not hash the contents of the pex (used for in-place builds).
